# Description
This is my first challenge assignment from my full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the assignment was to debug a code as well as doing a bit of cleaning.

The changes I have made is
  - I changed the original title from "website" to "Horiseon"
  - The "search-engine-optimization" hyperlink wasn't working, so I added an id under the "content" class
  - Images were missing the alt property, so I added an alt to the images
  - The elements header, main, and footer were added
  - I split up the "content" and "benefits" class into their own section element allowing it to become easier to read
  - I changed the heading from h2 to h4 from the footer allowing for proper order
  - I put the codes in the style.css in sequential order
  - I added comments to the css to to describe actions of the command
